# Overview

This is a React project I created based on the free UI offered here: https://www.uplabs.com/posts/restaurant-booking-app-uikit

## Goal
In this project, I'm implementing new React tools as I learn them, but the main purpose of this project is to improve my ability to break a design into logical components and style them using the BEM CSS naming convention.
